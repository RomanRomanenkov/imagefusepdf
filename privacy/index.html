If you do not agree, please uninstall the Extension and discontinue its use.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Who We Are &amp; How to Contact Us</h2><p class="mb-4">ImageFuse PDF is a browser extension that allows you to convert images to PDF directly in your browser.</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>ImageFuse PDF</li><li>Contact email: <a href="mailto:imagefusepdf@gmail.com" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark underline">imagefusepdf@gmail.com</a></li><li>Website: <a href="https://imagefusepdf.com" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark underline">https://imagefusepdf.com</a></li></ul><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us using the email above.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Scope of this Policy</h2><p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy applies to the ImageFuse PDF browser extension only.</p><p class="mb-2">It does not apply to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Websites you visit while using your browser</li><li>Third-party services where you may upload or share PDFs created with the Extension (e.g. email providers, cloud storage, messaging apps)</li><li>The browser vendor (such as Google Chrome) or the extension store itself and any data they collect under their own policies</li></ul><p>Please review the privacy policies of any such third parties separately.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Summary – Key Principles</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>The Extension is designed with a local-first / no-server approach.</li><li>Your images and generated PDFs are processed locally in your browser and are not sent to our servers.</li><li>We do not collect, sell, or rent your personal information via the Extension.</li><li>We do not use third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising networks within the Extension.</li></ul><p>The rest of this Privacy Policy explains these points in more detail.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Information We Process While You Use the Extension</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4.1 Images and PDFs</h3><p class="mb-4">When you use ImageFuse PDF, you may add images in various ways (for example, by selecting files from your device or using a context menu on an image in a web page).</p><p class="mb-2">To provide the core functionality, the Extension may temporarily handle:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>The image files you choose to convert (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.)</li><li>Basic image-related information such as file name, size, and dimensions, only as needed to generate the PDF</li><li>The PDF file generated from those images</li></ul><p>All of this processing happens within your browser on your device. The Extension does not upload these images or PDFs to our servers.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4.2 Local Storage in the Browser</h3><p class="mb-4">To make the Extension convenient to use, it may store certain information in your browser&#x27;s local extension storage, such as:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>The list of images you have added and their order</li><li>Thumbnail previews of images (where applicable)</li><li>Your PDF configuration or preferences (e.g., page size, orientation, margins)</li></ul><p class="mb-4">This information is stored only in your browser profile on your device and is used solely to provide and improve the functionality of the Extension (for example, restoring your working session or remembering preferences).</p><p class="mb-4">We do not receive this data, and it is not shared with third parties by us.</p><p class="mb-2">You can clear this data at any time by:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Removing images or using &quot;clear&quot; functions within the Extension; and/or</li><li>Clearing extension data/cache via your browser&#x27;s settings; and/or</li><li>Uninstalling the Extension.</li></ul></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Information We Do Not Collect</h2><p class="mb-2">Through the Extension itself, we:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or contact details.</li><li>Do not collect your browsing history or track the websites you visit.</li><li>Do not inspect or monitor the content of web pages you view, beyond what is necessary when you explicitly use the Extension on a specific image.</li><li>Do not upload your images, generated PDFs, or related metadata to our servers.</li><li>Do not include third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies inside the Extension.</li></ul><p>The only personal data we may have about you is information you voluntarily provide if you contact us (for example, by email for support). In that case, we will use this information only to respond to your inquiry and maintain basic records where legally required.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Permissions and How They Are Used</h2><p class="mb-4">When you install ImageFuse PDF, your browser may ask you to grant certain permissions. These permissions are requested exclusively to provide the features you expect from an image-to-PDF extension.</p><p class="mb-2">Typical permissions and their purpose may include:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li><strong>Access to data on websites you visit (limited to images you interact with using the Extension):</strong> Needed so that, when you explicitly choose the Extension&#x27;s action on an image (for example, via a right-click &quot;Save to PDF&quot; menu), it can access that particular image to add it to your PDF.</li><li><strong>Storage permission (extension storage):</strong> Used to store images you&#x27;ve added, their order, and your configuration settings locally in your browser, so your workflow persists between sessions.</li><li><strong>UI / side panel or similar interface permissions:</strong> Required so the Extension can display its interface, show previews, and let you manage your images and PDF options.</li></ul><p>We only request the minimum set of permissions that is reasonably necessary for the Extension to function as described.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Third Parties, Analytics, and Advertising</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>The Extension does not use third-party analytics or tracking services.</li><li>The Extension does not display third-party advertisements.</li><li>The Extension does not share your images, PDFs, or related metadata with third parties.</li></ul><p>If you choose to share or upload your generated PDFs using other services (e.g., by email or cloud storage), that is entirely under your control and is governed by the privacy policies of those services.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">8. Browser Vendors and Extension Stores</h2><p class="mb-4">Your browser vendor (for example, Google for Chrome) and the extension store may collect their own diagnostic or usage information such as:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Install and uninstall counts</li><li>Crash reports, performance metrics, or error logs</li><li>Aggregate usage statistics</li></ul><p class="mb-4">These are handled under the privacy policies of the respective vendors and stores and are separate from the functioning of the Extension itself.</p><p>We may have access to aggregated, anonymized statistics provided by the store (such as total number of installs or basic error reports). These reports do not identify individual users.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">9. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2><p class="mb-4">If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, our processing of personal data (which, in practice, is very minimal) is based on the following legal grounds:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To provide you with the Extension and its core functionality (image-to-PDF conversion).</li><li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> To maintain and improve the Extension, ensure security, and respond to support requests.</li></ul><p class="mb-4">Because the Extension does not send usage data or images to our servers, these legal bases primarily apply if and when you contact us directly and provide personal data in that context.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Your Rights</h3><p class="mb-2">Where applicable law grants you rights, you may have the right to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Access personal data we hold about you</li><li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li><li>Request deletion of your data</li><li>Object to or restrict our processing</li><li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li></ul><p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:imagefusepdf@gmail.com" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark underline">imagefusepdf@gmail.com</a>. Please note that, because we generally do not store personal data about the use of the Extension, we may have little or no data associated with you.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)</h2><p class="mb-4">If you are a resident of California, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), including:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>The right to know what personal information (if any) is collected, used, disclosed, or sold</li><li>The right to request deletion of your personal information</li><li>The right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information</li><li>The right to non-discrimination for exercising these rights</li></ul><p class="mb-4">ImageFuse PDF does not sell or share personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA/CPRA, and the Extension does not collect usage data or images on our servers.</p><p>If you contact us directly and provide personal information, we will handle any requests relating to that information in line with applicable law. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:imagefusepdf@gmail.com" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark underline">imagefusepdf@gmail.com</a>.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">11. Children&#x27;s Privacy</h2><p class="mb-4">The Extension is intended for general-purpose use and is not directed to children or designed for use by individuals under the age at which they can provide consent to data processing in their jurisdiction (for example, 13 or 16 years old, depending on the country).</p><p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children through the Extension. If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can take appropriate steps to delete such information if necessary.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">12. Data Security</h2><p class="mb-4">Because ImageFuse PDF processes images and generates PDFs directly in your browser:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Your images and PDFs are kept on your device and under your control.</li><li>Data stored by the Extension is contained in your browser&#x27;s extension storage area.</li></ul><p class="mb-4">We aim to follow good security practices in developing and maintaining the Extension. However, no software system is completely secure. You are responsible for:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Keeping your devices secure</li><li>Using supported browser versions</li><li>Applying security patches and updates offered by your browser and operating system</li></ul><p>If we become aware of a security vulnerability in the Extension that may affect user privacy, we will take reasonable steps to address it (for example, by issuing an update via the extension store).</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">13. Data Retention and Deletion</h2><p class="mb-2">As a general rule:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>We do not store your images or PDFs on our servers.</li><li>Data used by the Extension is kept locally in your browser storage only for as long as it is needed to provide the functionality (e.g., while images are added and until you clear them or uninstall the Extension).</li></ul><p class="mb-2">You can delete locally stored data by:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Removing images and using &quot;clear&quot; or similar functions in the Extension;</li><li>Clearing your browser&#x27;s extension data or cache via browser settings;</li><li>Uninstalling the Extension.</li></ul><p>If you contact us and provide personal data (for example, by email), we may retain that communication for as long as reasonably necessary for support, legal, or record-keeping purposes, in accordance with applicable law.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2><p class="mb-4">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4"><li>Reflect changes in the Extension&#x27;s functionality;</li><li>Comply with new legal requirements; or</li><li>Clarify our practices.</li></ul><p class="mb-4">When we make changes, we will update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this document. If the changes are material, we may also provide additional notice (for example, through the extension store listing or a brief notice in the Extension interface).</p><p>If we ever introduce new features that involve collecting or transmitting personal data in a way not described in this Policy, we will update this Privacy Policy before those changes take effect.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">15.
